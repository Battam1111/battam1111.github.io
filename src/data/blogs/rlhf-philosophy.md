## 🌌 Introduction

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is often viewed through a technical lens — as a method to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to align better with user intent. But under the surface lies a deeper, **philosophical motivation**.

## 🔍 The Reward Fallacy

The traditional reward signal is inadequate for capturing human values. It’s brittle, hackable, and often misaligned. The idea that we can **predefine reward functions** for intelligent agents breaks down in the real world.

> “A perfectly rewarded system is not necessarily a morally aligned system.”

## 🤝 RLHF as Dialogical Learning

Human feedback is not just “correction” — it’s conversation. RLHF introduces **human intent into the learning loop**, which makes the agent a _collaborative learner_, not a reward-maximizer.

## 🧠 Conclusion

RLHF isn’t a patch. It’s a philosophical shift:  
From **solving** the reward function → to **evolving** through feedback.

> Perhaps intelligence is not about maximizing — but **negotiating**.
