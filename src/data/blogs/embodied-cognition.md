## 🤖 What is Embodied Cognition?

Embodied cognition argues that **mind is not separate from body** — our thoughts arise from our physical interaction with the world.

AI researchers have often ignored embodiment in favor of symbolic or disembodied models. But recent advances in robotics and sensorimotor learning are changing this.

## 🌍 Why Agents Need Bodies

Without a body, agents lack:

- **Perceptual grounding**  
- **Physical causality**  
- **Temporal continuity**  

This leads to brittle generalization and a lack of **common sense**.

## 🔬 Neuroscience Agrees

Studies of the human brain show that sensory-motor regions are deeply involved in abstract reasoning. Even language comprehension activates **motor neurons**.

## 🧭 The Future

LLMs + robots ≠ sci-fi anymore.

The most robust agents will be those that **live, move, and learn** in the real world.
